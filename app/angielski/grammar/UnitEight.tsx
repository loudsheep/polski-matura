                    <p>
                        If the report is after the time the thing was said or written, the verb form generally changes as follows:
                    </p>
                    <img src="/image/reported.png"></img>
                    <p>
                        The verb form does not need to change when:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The information being reported is unchanged. <br />
                            <em>Sea temperatures are rising,' said the lecturer</em> <br />
                            <em>The lecturer told us (that) sea temperatures are rising.</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>The information being reported happened recently. <br />
                            <em>'I'll tell you about it tomorrow,' she said</em> <br />
                            <em>She said (that) she'll tell me about it tomorrow (It's still the same day.)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>The information being reported contains the modals would, could, might, ought to and should or must for logical deduction. <br />
                            <em>'I think he must be late,' she said</em> <br />
                            <em>She said (that) she thought he must be late.</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>The information being reported contains the past perfect. <br />
                            <em>'He had already been invited to the reception,' she said</em> <br />
                            <em>She said (that) he had already been invited to the reception.</em>
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Reported Yes/No questions:</strong> When there is no question word in the direct speech question, we use if/whether. The word order is the same as in the statement. The verb tense and other changes are the same as for other types of reported speech. <br />
                        <em>'Could I borrow your notes?' she asked</em> <br />
                        <em>She asked if/whether she could borrow my notes.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Reported wh-questions:</strong> The wh- word is followed by statement word order (subject+ verb). The verb tense and other changes are the same as for other types of reported speech. <br />
                        <em>'Why did you leave that job?' she asked him</em> <br />
                        <em>She asked him why he had left that job.</em>
