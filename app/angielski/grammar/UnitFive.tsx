        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1.1 Substitution</h3>
        <p>
          Substitution involves using other words such as it, one, do, there, that, so, neither, and not.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've been to Laos several times, but as Lain hadn't been there, he decided to join us on our last trip.

          Bill doesn't like Chinese food and neither do I.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1.2 Ellipsis</h3>
        <p>Ellipsis involves leaving out words to avoid repetition.</p>

          <li>After and, but, and or:</li>
          <li>She felt hurt and left angry about what they had said about her.</li>
          <li>They were pleased but were a little embarrassed about receiving such an expensive gift.</li>
          <li>I'm thinking of getting her a bag for her tablet or perhaps getting her a top.</li>
          <li>At the end of a verb phrase:</li>
          <li>She wanted to spend more than ten days in Melbourne but she couldn't.</li>
          <li>She said she was going to talk to an accountant and she has.</li>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2.1 Wish</h3>
        <p>
          We use wish + past simple to express a wish for circumstances to change in the present. When wish is followed by
          a form of the verb be, we often use were instead of was, especially in more formal styles. We use this structure
          when we want our own situation (or the situation of the person who is doing the wishing) to be different.
        </p>
        <p>I wish Kathy lived here.</p>
        <p>Don't you wish you spoke another language?</p>
        <p>I wish he were a little more open-minded.</p>
        <p>We all wish the economy weren't so unstable.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <p>
          We use wish + would to talk about other people's irritating habits.
        </p>
        <p>I wish my brother-in-law would sell that old car.</p>
        <p>I wish he wouldn't complain about the weather all the time.</p>
        <p>Watch out! This form is rarely used with I or we. To talk about wishes we have for ourselves, we use could.</p>
        <p>I wish I could buy a new computer.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <p>
          We use wish + could to talk about an ability we would like to have or a habit we would like to change.
        </p>
        <p>I wish I could learn to be a bit tidier.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <p>
          We use wish + past perfect to refer to things we are sorry about in the past or to express regret.
        </p>
        <p>I wish I had started learning Spanish when I was younger.</p>
        <p>She wishes she hadn't lost her temper.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2.2 If Only</h3>
        <p>
          We use if only with the same verb forms as wish when our feelings are stronger. We often use it with an exclamation
          mark. We also use it with would/wouldn't to criticize someone else's behavior.
        </p>
        <p>If only I could take back the dreadful things I said!</p>
        <p>If only the neighbors would stop making so much noise!</p>
        <p>If only I had never left my hometown!</p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2.3 It's Time</h3>
        <p>
          We use it's time with the past simple to talk about the present or future. We mean that the action should have
          been done before. For emphasis, we can also use it's about time and it's high time.
        </p>
        <p>It's (about) time you went to bed. You've got an early start tomorrow.</p>
        <p>It's (high) time we left for the airport. We're supposed to check in an hour and a half before the flight.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2.4 Would Rather</h3>
        <p>
          We use would rather + past simple to talk about preferences in the present and future.
        </p>
        <p>I'd rather you didn't mention this to Alex.</p>
        <p>Would you rather I came back a bit later?</p>
        <p>I'd rather we didn't eat out tonight. I'll cook something here.</p>
        <p>
          We use would rather + past perfect to say what we wanted to happen in the past.
        </p>
        <p>I'd rather you hadn't invited Tim. He doesn't get on well with Eleanor.</p>
        <p>I'd rather you had informed me of your decision sooner.</p>
        <p>
          Watch out! We don't use would rather + past simple or past perfect when we are talking about our own preferences
          for ourselves or other people's preferences for themselves. In these cases, we use would rather + infinitive
          without to.
        </p>
        <p>I'd rather fly than catch the train.</p>
        <p>They'd rather take a taxi.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
