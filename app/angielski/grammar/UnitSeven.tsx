                <p>
                    It is possible to have sentences that mix conditionals in an if clause referring to the past with a main clause
                    referring to the present or future.

                <p>
                    Common conditional linking words are if, as/so long as, unless, even if, whether, providing, provided (that), on
                    condition that. When the clause with the conditional linking word is at the beginning of the sentence, there is a
                    comma. When the main clause begins the sentence, there is no comma.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2.2 Formal Style</h3>
                <p>
                    In more formal styles we can omit 'if' but we have to place the auxiliary verb before the subject.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Had I known you were not going to be available, I would have called the meeting for another day.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>If + should is common in formal letters. For even greater formality, omit 'if' and begin the sentence with 'should'.</p>

                <p>
                    We use if + (should) happen to to suggest that something is more unlikely or just a chance possibility. Should and
                    happen can be used together.

                <p>
                    Suppose means 'what if...?' and it is used with the present simple to describe something that may possibly happen or
                    may have happened.
                </p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    It is used with the past simple to talk about something that is imaginary or which is unlikely to happen in the
                    future.

                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    It is used with the past perfect to talk about something that could have happened in the past but didn't.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose we had never met. Do you think you would have married Silvia?</li>
