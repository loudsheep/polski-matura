                <p>With adjectives ending in one syllable, we use -er and -est (-ier, -iest for adjectives ending in -y).</p>

                <p>
                    With longer adjectives, adjectives ending in -full, -less, -ing and adverbs which have the same form as the
                    adjective, we use more/less and the most/least.

                <p>We can use the following words to intensify and modify comparative forms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>considerably</li>
                    <li>far</li>
                    <li>much</li>

                    <li>very much bigger/better</li>
                    <li>more and more difficult</li>
                    <li>a bit/slightly/a little higher</li>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1.3 Like in comparisons</h3>
                <p>We use like + noun to describe similarity:</p>
                <p>He's tall like his father.</p>
                <p>We use nothing like as to emphasize the difference between two things:</p>
                <p>Driving is nothing like as fast as going by train.</p>
                <p>Watch out! As is only used in comparisons.</p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Modifying adverbs</h2>
                <p>
                    We can use adverbs to make adjectives, other adverbs and verbs stronger (intensifiers) or weaker (modifiers).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can use these adverbs before gradable adjectives (i.e. adjectives that can be used in the comparative) and
                    adverbs bitterly, barely, deeply, somewhat, seriously, really, extremely, practically, entirely, pretty,
                    completely, quite, scarcely, totally, very.
                </p>
                <p>Some examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>bitterly cold/ashamed/disappointed/divided</li>
                    <li>barely alive/legible/comprehensible</li>
                    <li>completely serious/open/honest</li>
                    <li>deeply serious/painful/sorry</li>
                    <li>entirely convinced/clear/satisfactory</li>
                    <li>pretty doubtful/hopeless</li>
                    <li>perfectly capable/aware/reasonable/normal/safe/straightforward/sure</li>
                    <li>seriously alarmed/worried/hurt</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Extreme or absolute (non-gradable) adjectives include amazing, devastating, disastrous, fantastic, freezing, furious, immense, impossible, staggering. We can use the following adverbs with extreme adjectives: absolutely, totally, really, utterly, pretty, quite.</p>
                <p>The building was utterly immense. Watch out! When used with non-gradable adjectives, quite means absolutely, not fairly.</p>
