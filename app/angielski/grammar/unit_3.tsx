                    <p>We use going to + infinitive or the present continuous to talk about plans and arrangements that have already been decided.</p>
                    <p>She's decided she's going to get another job.</p>
                    <p>Where are you meeting Max this evening?</p>

                    <p>We use the future continuous (will/shall + be + -ing) to say that an action will be in progress at a definite time in the future.</p>
                    <p>I'll be living in my own apartment by this time next year.</p>

                    <p>We use the future perfect (will/shall + have + past participle) to describe something that will be completed before a definite time in the future.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the month, I will have completed my dissertation.</p>

                <div className="mb-6">
                    <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Introductory It</h2>
                    <p>We use it as an introductory subject to avoid beginning a sentence with an infinitive or -ing form.</p>
                    <p>It would probably be better to give her a gift voucher for Christmas.</p>
                    <p>It's been lovely having you to stay with us.</p>
                    <p>To emphasize a relative clause (cleft sentence).</p>
                    <p>It was Julia who gave Sally a bag for her birthday (the emphasis is on Julia).</p>
                    <p>It was a bag that Julia gave Sally for her birthday (the emphasis is on a bag).</p>
                    <p>It was Sally who Julia gave a bag to (the emphasis is on Sally).</p>
                    <p>When the subject of a clause is another clause.</p>
                    <p>It's terrible just how many young people are unemployed.</p>
                    <p>It's likely that his plane will be delayed.</p>
                    <p>It's always a relief when the cool weather arrives.</p>
                    <p>We use it as an introductory object in the structure: subject + verb + it + adjective + infinitive/clause.</p>
                    <p>I find it very strange the way you never tell me where you're going.</p>
                    <p>They made it perfectly clear that they wanted a window and an aisle seat on the plane.</p>
                    <p>Watch out! We do not normally use subject + verb + it + adjective + infinitive/clause if there is no adjective.</p>
                    <p>I find the way Joe keeps telling us what to do really annoying.</p>
