                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1. Coherence and Cohesion</h3>
                <p>We say that a text is coherent if we can see logical connections between the various parts of the text. We indicate these connections by using cohesive devices.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-8">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1.2 Cohesive Devices</h3>
                <p>There are two types of cohesion: grammatical cohesion and lexical cohesion. Grammatical cohesion includes reference, substitution, ellipsis, and conjunction. Lexical cohesion involves links between the vocabulary items in the text, such as collocations, repetitions, or the use of synonyms, antonyms, etc.</p>

            <div className="mb-8">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1. Reference</h3>
                <p>Reference is the use of pronouns and determiners to refer back or forward to full forms used earlier or later in the text.</p>
                <p>Ralph spent all morning washing the car. It needed a clean and he knew this was the only time he had available.</p>
                <p>Jane saw him walking towards her - Richard Johnson, the boy she had met the summer before.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-8">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. Substitution</h3>
                <p>We use substitution to avoid repeating certain words in a sentence. Substitution can be used to replace a noun, a verb, or even a phrase.</p>
                <p>I was making a sandwich for Sue, but she said she didn't want one.</p>
                <p>We had planned to take the scenic route but we were advised that to do so would add an extra hour to our journey.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-8">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3. Ellipsis</h3>
                <p>When we use ellipsis, we simply omit the words that we wish to avoid repeating.</p>
                <p>A: Are you coming to the party?<br />B: I'll try (to come to the party) but I'm not sure I can (come to the party)</p>
                <p>A: Frances isn't staying with Patricia after all.<br />B: Why (is Frances) not (staying with Patricia)?</p>
            </div>

            <div className="mb-8">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">4. Conjunction</h3>
                <p>We use conjunction to link ideas in a text.</p>
                <p>Coordinating conjunctions include and, or, but, so, nor, and yet.</p>
                <p>Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, as far as, as if, as long as, as soon as, as though, because, before, if, in order that, since, so, so that, than, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, and while. We use them to link a subordinate clause to a main clause.</p>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2.1 Negative Adverbs/Adverbial Expressions</h3>
                    <p>We can put a negative adverb or adverbial expression at the beginning of a clause for emphasis. When we do this, there is inversion of the auxiliary and subject.</p>
                    <p>Under no circumstances should you share your password with others.</p>
                    <p>At no time did she consider any other possibility.</p>
                    <p>Not until she had failed to make contact for over twenty-four hours did they contact the police.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="mb-8">
                    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2.2 Restrictive Words and Expressions</h3>
                    <p>We can also put certain restrictive words or expressions at the beginning of the clause for emphasis. We are more likely to use inversion in formal or literary contexts.</p>
                    <p>Hardly had I arrived in Paris when I received a call telling me I had to return home urgently.</p>
                    <p>No sooner had I sat down to have a cup of tea than the telephone rang.</p>
                    <p>Seldom have I felt so moved by a piece of orchestral music.</p>
                    <p>Little did I know that they were planning to replace me as project leader.</p>
                    <p>Never had his wife looked more beautiful.</p>
                    <p>Only when I saw him again did I realize just how good a friend he had been.</p>
                    <p>Not only have you missed several classes, you have also failed to submit all the written work.</p>
